Article,Newcastle Buys $122M Multifamily Portfolio,"January 17, 2008",By GlobeSt.com,"CHICAGO - Newcastle Ltd., based here, is buying a seven-property, multifamily portfolio in Chicago’s Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighborhoods. The total acquisition price for the 896-unit portfolio is $122.5 million, says Michael Haney, president and CEO of Newcastle. The seller is an affiliate of Wexenthaller Realty Management, based here. Newcastle has already closed on the Belmont House, 3170 N. Sheridan Rd., which it acquired for $56 million, Haney says. The firm expects to close on the remaining properties within 30 days, he says.<br><br>Besides Belmont House, the portfolio includes a 75-unit apartment building at 532 W. Roscoe; a nine-story 146-unit apartment building at 425 W. Surf; a 48-unit apartment building at 3610 N. Pine Grove; a 143-unit apartment building at 707 W. Sheridan Rd.; a 90-unit apartment building at 510 W. Wellington; and a 119-room hostel at 616 W. Arlington. All of the apartment buildings have occupancy rates between 97% and 98%, Haney tells GlobeSt.com. The average unit size for the portfolio is 650 sf. The majority of the buildings were constructed in the 1920’s. The buildings on Roscoe, Pine Grove and 707 W. Sheridan were constructed in the 1970’s. “A lot of these properties have parking associated with them,” he says. “Across the portfolio, there are 0.5 spaces per unit, which is pretty unique in this neighborhood.”<br><br>The 13-story Belmont House has 269 apartments and 9,000 sf of retail space. The apartments are 97% leased and are a mixture of studio, one-, two-, three- bedroom and penthouse units. The average unit size is slightly more than 800 sf and the average rental rate is “in excess of $1,500,” Haney tells GlobeSt.com. The retail is 100% leased to service retail for the building and surrounding community. The 315,000-sf building was constructed in 1924 as a luxury hotel and was renovated about 10 years ago. The building has views of Lake Michigan and is near Lake Shore Drive and amenities, Haney says. “We thought this building had an excellent location. It has great access and visibility,” he says. The firm expects to spend about $8 million on improvements to the building, such as renovating the common areas and improvements to the units’ bathrooms and kitchen.<br><br>Newcastle was initially only interested in the Belmont House, but the seller wanted to sell the building as part of the portfolio. “It was a pretty rare opportunity to acquire a portfolio of well-run apartment buildings that have a great location in what is really kind of a core market in Chicago,” Haney says. Newcastle is assuming some of the seller’s debt and was able to structure the financing so that the seller will not receive pre-payment penalties, he says.<br><br>The firm plans to do minor renovations and improvements to each of the buildings, though a total estimate for the improvements was not available. Newcastle does not have plans to redevelop the hostel into an apartment building. “Right now, our plan is to continue to operate it as is. There are very few of these properties in Chicago and it has performed very well,” he says. Haney says the firm expects to have long-term holds on the properties. “We like to underwrite properties on<br>a 10-year hold,” he says.<br><br>Newcastle acquired the properties as part of its $500 million Chicago investment platform. Newcastle is focusing on multifamily and retail properties with a transaction range between $5 million and $50 million. The geographical focus is urban areas in the Chicago area, including the city, and downtown areas of the suburbs. The firm is acquiring stabilized assets, redevelopment properties and developments, he says.

Roscoe; a nine-story 146-unit apartment building at 425 W. Surf; a 48-unit apartment building at 3610 N. Pine Grove; a 143-unit apartment building at 707 W. Sheridan Rd.; a 90-unit apartment building at 510 W. Wellington; and a 119-room hostel at 616 W. Arlington. All of the apartment buildings have occupancy rates between 97% and 98%, Haney tells GlobeSt.com. The average unit size for the portfolio is 650 sf. The majority of the buildings were constructed in the 1920’s. The buildings on Roscoe, Pine Grove and 707 W. Sheridan were constructed in the 1970’s. “A lot of these properties have parking associated with them,” he says. “Across the portfolio, there are 0.5 spaces per unit, which is pretty unique in this neighborhood.”<br><br>The 13-story Belmont House has 269 apartments and 9,000 sf of retail space. The apartments are 97% leased and are a mixture of studio, one-, two-, three- bedroom and penthouse units. The average unit size is slightly more than 800 sf and the average rental rate is “in excess of $1,500,” Haney tells GlobeSt.com. The retail is 100% leased to service retail for the building and surrounding community. The 315,000-sf building was constructed in 1924 as a luxury hotel and was renovated about 10 years ago. The building has views of Lake Michigan and is near Lake Shore Drive and amenities, Haney says. “We thought this building had an excellent location. It has great access and visibility,” he says. The firm expects to spend about $8 million on improvements to the building, such as renovating the common areas and improvements to the units’ bathrooms and kitchen.<br><br>Newcastle was initially only interested in the Belmont House, but the seller wanted to sell the building as part of the portfolio. “It was a pretty rare opportunity to acquire a portfolio of well-run apartment buildings that have a great location in what is really kind of a core market in Chicago,” Haney says. Newcastle is assuming some of the seller’s debt and was able to structure the financing so that the seller will not receive pre-payment penalties, he says.<br><br>The firm plans to do minor renovations and improvements to each of the buildings, though a total estimate for the improvements was not available. Newcastle does not have plans to redevelop the hostel into an apartment building. “Right now, our plan is to continue to operate it as is. There are very few of these properties in Chicago and it has performed very well,” he says. Haney says the firm expects to have long-term holds on the properties. “We like to underwrite properties on<br>a 10-year hold,” he says.<br><br>Newcastle acquired the properties as part of its $500 million Chicago investment platform. Newcastle is focusing on multifamily and retail properties with a transaction range between $5 million and $50 million. The geographical focus is urban areas in the Chicago area, including the city, and downtown areas of the suburbs. The firm is acquiring stabilized assets, redevelopment properties and developments, he says. Since the beginning of 2007, when Newcastle started the platform, the firm has acquired more than 900 apartment units in the Chicago area.",,

Children will be referred to the new facility by their school districts.<br><br>Researchers are hoping to find a genetic marker for autism, which is four times more common in boys than in girls, to determine how the disorder works physiologically. Scientists do not have a biological test for the disorder and must use behavioral tests and history to make a diagnosis, Porges said.<br><br>Additionally, clinicians and teachers will have the opportunity to learn about autism through training and observation of the children at the school.<br><br>Most clinicians have limited exposure to autistic children before coming in contact with them at a clinic, Porges said. Researchers will be able to use the school “as a portal to train professionals to be familiar with autistic children,” he said.",,

Article,Appraising the Situation,"October 1, 2006","By Kevin Jeselnik, Heartland Real Estate Business","In some cases, an appraisal may not be the best way to determine a property’s value.<br><br>When one wants to establish the value of a property, an appraisal is the standard means by which a property owner can find its worth. Appraisals, guided by the Appraisal Institute standards, can be implemented in three ways: the sales comparison approach, which compares three to five similar properties sold to the subject property under appraisal; the cost approach, in which an appraiser estimates the value of any improvements that have been made, subtracts the amount of depreciation of the improvements, and adds an estimate of value of the site itself; and the income capitalization approach, which is derived by dividing a property’s net operating income by the desired rate of return.<br><br>The other major use of an appraisal is to find a property’s highest and best use. The four criteria to establish highest and best use are whether the use is physically possible; legally permissible; financially feasible; and creates maximum profitability.<br><br>While an appraisal is a good way to establish a basic value of a development site or existing property, sometimes the limitations of its methodology constrain its ability to obtain the best value.<br><br>“At the end of the day, an appraisal is an opinion of value,” says Peter Tortorello, vice president and partner at Chicago-based Newcastle Limited, a commercial real estate advisory and development firm. “Regardless of the type of appraisal, it needs to conform to the uniform methodology established by the Appraisal Institute.”<br><br>“An appraiser cannot work outside the three established approaches to value and still consider its assessment an appraisal,” explains Michael Haney, president of Newcastle Limited. “We have considered some instances we have run across where appraisals didn’t apply the best value.”<br><br>Condemnation<br>If a property owner is facing the possible condemnation of its property, it might not be in its best interest to have an appraisal on file, says Haney. “Appraisals are what the courts or an attorney consider ‘discoverable,’ the condemning body could obtain any appraisal that may have been completed on the property” he explains. “If an appraisal is written from an approach that is not in your best interest, it may start to establish a value that is less than what a property owner would get through a condemnation if they handled it as a more typical condemnation negotiation.”<br><br>If facing condemnation, Haney advises that instead of calling an appraiser the condemned property’s owner speak with a real estate advisor or condemnation attorney to establish a strategy for responding to the condemning party. “While it is important to have appraisers on your side if it’s necessary in a condemnation, you do not want to go out and just order an appraisal; that can work against you,” Haney says.<br><br>Redevelopment/Rezoning<br>Another situation where an appraisal may not be the best manner by which one can valuate a property is when a property is likely to be redeveloped or rezoned. “With unimproved or redeveloped land, the sales comparison approach has to be used,” Tortorello explains. “When you get into urban areas, and zoning and adjacent land uses come into play, it is really difficult to compare a property to another property that is perhaps eight blocks away, when zoning issues and such can change drastically within that distance.”<br><br>Using the sales comparison approach, an appraiser can compare two 15,000-square foot properties under different zoning on different streets and complete a sensitivity analysis by making a percentage adjustment based on one of the property’s superior location or inferior frontage. “However, it becomes very difficult to value a property that is to be redeveloped or rezoned simply on a per square foot basis,” Tortorello says. “You need to take a look at the property on a floor area ratio basis, which is the total square footage that can be developed on the site.”<br><br>An appraisal may value the land based on its location and size, but not include the value added by what can be developed on the land. “One needs to be careful in a situation in which a property is being redeveloped to look at what the development potential is,” Haney says. “It needs to be valuated on that potential development, not on the value of the land on an as-is basis. Often in a redevelopment/rezoning situation, appraisers will under-value a property because they are not really allowed under the [appraisal] methodology to get into a property’s potential.”<br><br>To determine the true value of such a property, it must be evaluated from the point of view of a developer, for its potential worth in its future state rather than as it stands at the time. Using the residual analysis to calculate land value of a development is one way to evaluate its worth, which essentially deduces how much a developer would be willing to pay for the land measured against the prospective investment return a particular project might draw from the site. What a developer can afford to pay may be substantially different than the appraised value of the existing building.<br><br>Community/Political Issues<br>When a development site or existing facility is the subject of community or political scrutiny, appraisals can sometimes over-value a property. “Especially in large cities such as Chicago, even if a property is zoned for an intensive use, community groups can influence political forces and limit what a development can be,” Haney explains. “Sometimes, looking at a property’s potential based on current zoning can actually result in someone overestimating what could realistically be achieved on that property.”<br><br>Many owners might say that having one’s property over-value is not a bad thing, but if someone is trying to decide whether to sell a property or not it could be. An owner needs to have as accurate an estimation of its property’s value as possible; it may not be as valuable as it seems after it has been run through the political machine. “It’s difficult within the context of the Appraisal Institute standards for an appraiser to really take into account political influences that might affect a property’s value,” Haney says.<br><br>In this situation, a residual analysis will help determine value, but the interested parties must dig deeper to understand the political and community back-story. “It’s a very circumstance-specific issue,” Haney notes. “Sometimes a group is against a certain tenant, sometimes the worry revolves around building height or shadows, or there might be concern about the need for more affordable housing or additional landscaping.”<br><br>Physical Barriers and Technical Challenges<br>When a property possible has physical or geotechnical problems, an appraisal may not take these issues into account. It is not required that any in-depth site work or due diligence is performed when an appraiser valuates a property. This means that the presence of wetlands, potential environmental contamination, or other problems such as the distance between the property and certain utilities may be overlooked and not reflected in the established value.<br><br>“These kinds of factors can have a significant impact on value, but because an appraiser is not required to do an in-depth analysis, this type of information is not brought to bear on the value on which an appraiser settles,” Haney says. Having a third-party consultant evaluate the property for potential environmental challenges is important in order to establish an accurate price.<br><br>Impact of Ongoing Business<br>“If the property is developed for a special use, or if the value of the property is derived from the income stream, it may be difficult to establish value through appraisals,” Tortorello says.<br><br>Haney has an example that illustrates how projects developed for a specific use are hard to valuate. Newcastle is developing a school for children with autism in Chicago with Easter Seals Metropolitan Chicago. “It’s a not-for-profit, so you can’t take an income capitalization approach to valuate it because it is not generating a profit,” Haney explains. “The sales comparison approach doesn’t make sense because schools do not trade often and it would certainly be hard to find comparable schools nearby. And the cost methodology doesn’t work well either, because a school for autism has to be specially designed and has a lot of unique and expensive interior finishes.” It would be very difficult to explain to a bank or investor why a project like this cost so much – the special needs of the kids – through an appraisal.<br><br>As these examples show, there are several unique cases wherein an appraisal would not be the most accurate method to valuate a property. In each case, it is advisable to contact a real estate consultant and find ways to evaluate the property to best establish its worth. – K.J.<br><br>© 2006 Heartland Real Estate Business, all rights reserved.","In some cases, an appraisal may not be the best way to determine a property’s value.<br><br>When one wants to establish the value of a property, an appraisal is the standard means by which a property owner can find its worth.

Having a third-party consultant evaluate the property for potential environmental challenges is important in order to establish an accurate price.<br><br>Impact of Ongoing Business<br>“If the property is developed for a special use, or if the value of the property is derived from the income stream, it may be difficult to establish value through appraisals,” Tortorello says.<br><br>Haney has an example that illustrates how projects developed for a specific use are hard to valuate. Newcastle is developing a school for children with autism in Chicago with Easter Seals Metropolitan Chicago. “It’s a not-for-profit, so you can’t take an income capitalization approach to valuate it because it is not generating a profit,” Haney explains. “The sales comparison approach doesn’t make sense because schools do not trade often and it would certainly be hard to find comparable schools nearby. And the cost methodology doesn’t work well either, because a school for autism has to be specially designed and has a lot of unique and expensive interior finishes.” It would be very difficult to explain to a bank or investor why a project like this cost so much – the special needs of the kids – through an appraisal.<br><br>As these examples show, there are several unique cases wherein an appraisal would not be the most accurate method to valuate a property. In each case, it is advisable to contact a real estate consultant and find ways to evaluate the property to best establish its worth. – K.J.<br><br>© 2006 Heartland Real Estate Business, all rights reserved.",,

Article,"At a crossroads Driven by condo conversions, Rogers Park undergoes transformation","November 26, 2005","By Jane Adler, Chicago Tribune","The long–awaited revival of Rogers Park could finally be at hand as new residents move to a steadily growing stock of new condominiums in the North Side neighborhood.<br><br>Biv Ramlukan and his fiance, Fiona Mahomed, bought two new condominium units in Rogers Park––one to live in, the other as an investment. They had looked at condos in the obvious places where young professionals settle, including the South Loop. But they picked Rogers Park for much the same reason families move to far–out suburbs: more space for the money.<br><br>The couple’s condo at 1761 Morse Ave. has 1,400 square feet, plus upgraded finishes such as granite countertops, marble sinks and cherry cabinets. “This place is 300 square feet bigger than anything we saw downtown,” said Ramlukan, a business analyst. The unit cost $305,000, a figure much less than he says he would have paid for a similar size place in a trendier neighborhood. “There’s no Starbucks here yet,” he said, figuring the coffee shop’s arrival would guarantee the neighborhood’s renaissance. “But hopefully that will come.“<br><br>Also coming is a boost from Loyola University, a pivotal Rogers Park institution. The school plans to redevelop five parcels it owns near the Loyola “L” stop, including an unsightly building that previously housed a restaurant and now serves as the school’s fine arts building.<br><br>“People have been talking about Rogers Park coming back for the last 30 years,“ said Bill Markle, a real estate developer with a new project in the neighborhood. “They used to talk about Bucktown and Wicker Park that way.”<br><br>Situated on the lakefront adjacent to Evanston, Rogers Park has always seemed like a good real estate bet. The neighborhood, often referred to as East Rogers Park, is bounded by Ridge and Devon Avenues, the lake and the Evanston border. The neighborhood just to the west, commonly called West Rogers Park, is technically West Ridge, according to the Census Bureau.<br><br>The location and amenities in Rogers Park are big pluses, developers say.<br><br>The neighborhood is about nine miles north of downtown. The elevated and Metra train lines dissect the area. Rogers Park has many public beaches, among the most of Chicago’s lakefront areas.<br><br>“If you were any place else in the city, Rogers Park would be viewed as the best neighborhood because of the beach access,” says Rich Aronson, principal at Camelot Development Inc., Chicago. “With 13 public beaches, you can walk down just about any street to the beach.”<br><br>Despite the obvious attractions, Rogers Park has traditionally been for renters, not homeowners. Much of the housing stock consists of small apartments built in the 1920s and 1930s, when housing was in short supply.<br><br>Many of the apartments are in large courtyard buildings––charming, but often difficult to convert into spacious condominiums. This has held developers back. And many longtime residents, often vocal, want to keep the area affordable.<br><br>The neighborhood is diverse and densely populated. It also has a reputation as a home for transients, a stereotype that’s been hard to shake. At dinner time, as many as 150 people line up for a free meal at the Good News Community Kitchen at 7649 N. Paulina St.<br><br>A cook who works there and rents an apartment nearby worries about where she’ll live if rents go any higher.<br><br>Rentals are converted<br><br>But gradually rental buildings in Rogers Park are being converted into condos, and new homes are being built. No one has exact numbers, but 20 years ago rental apartments comprised about 85 percent of the area’s housing stock, according to Cary Steinbuck, executive director at the Rogers Park Community Council, a neighborhood improvement organization. Today about 70 percent of the housing stock is rental. “A lot of new condominiums have been built in the last three to four years,” she said.<br><br>In 2003, about 600 condominiums and townhouses in the neighborhood were sold, according to developer Aronson, who also co–owns Camelot Realty of America Inc., a property broker active in the area.<br><br>Based on the current sales pace, Aronson expects a final tally of about 1,200 unit sales in 2005. He estimates that about 10 percent of the 1,200 units are in newly constructed buildings. The remainder is in older buildings that have been converted into condominiums. “There’s a real appetite here for new construction,” he said.<br><br>Christopher Loubsky and Jeffrey Noren bought a new three–story townhouse at 6417 N. Paulina St. “The decision was based on value,” said Loubsky, who had previously lived in Evanston as well as the Chicago neighborhoods of Lakeview and River North. They paid $349,900 for a 1,860–square–foot house that includes a two–car garage. They like the location, which Loubsky describes as a cross between a suburban retreat and urban hub. When he sits on the rooftop deck among the treetops, he feels as if he’s not in the city. He added: “We can walk anywhere, and we’re very close to transportation.”<br><br>Nicole Thomas plans to move soon to her new two–bedroom condominium at North Beach Lofts, 1225 W. Morse Ave., about one block from the lake. She paid $265,000 for a two–bedroom, two–bath unit that includes an indoor parking space. Her new place has 1,050 square feet.<br><br>“The location is awesome,” said Thomas, owner of a Glenview photography company. Her walk to the beach will take about one minute. She’ll also have an easy commute downtown.<br><br>Thomas’ building, the North Beach Lofts, has 43 units. The building serves as a good example of a problem local developers face: lack of available land. The building was an old two–story commercial property built in the late 1930s, according to developer Markle, who is president of Markle Development Inc., Evanston. Markle added three floors of new condos above the old structure. He says 31 of the units are sold. The average size of the units is about 1,350 square feet.<br><br>Developer Kenneth Sproul faced a land challenge too. He built Lakeview Pointe, a big 57–unit project on Sheridan Road at the Evanston border. The project is unusual for Rogers Park because it’s on a big piece of land just across from the lake. The land had been occupied by a gas station, car wash and old apartment building. It also sits adjacent to the Calvary Cemetery, a detail Sproul admits has turned off some buyers.<br><br>“The project has sold slower than we had hoped,” said Sproul. He thinks his building might be a little “ahead of the market“ in Rogers Park, both in terms of unit size and price. The townhomes that remain for sale have about 2,000 square feet of space, with three bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths and two parking spots. The cost is about $465,000. A large 3,125–square– foot home in the project sold for $859,000.<br><br>“If someone is looking for a new townhome, they’re generally not looking in Rogers Park,” Sproul said. “Rogers Park is known as a condo–conversion area.” He thinks most buyers in Rogers Park are looking for units in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range.<br><br>Prices are on the upswing<br><br>Property prices in Rogers Park are on the upswing, however. Developer and property broker Aronson says prices have increased about 100 percent in the last two years. Newly constructed units now bring about $270 a square foot. Converted units a little less.<br><br>Jordan Mann paid $154,900 for a 700–square–foot condo in a newly rehabbed building at 1348 N. Estes Ave., about a half block from the lake and Loyola University. He looked at places in the Andersonville and Edgewater neighborhoods, but he picked the Rogers Park building because he got more space for the money. He also likes the area’s eclectic nature. “There are people here who were walking in peace marches 40 years ago, along with hip–hop kids and Hare Krishnas,” he said. He’s also glad an effort is under way to revitalize the neighborhood.<br><br>A big boost should come from Loyola University, which plans to spearhead the redevelopment of 5.4 acres it owns on the west side of Sheridan Road near the Loyola “L” stop. The properties will not be redeveloped for the school, but to provide more housing and retail stores for the neighborhood, according to Michael R. Haney, president at Newcastle Limited, the Chicago–based advisory firm Loyola hired to handle the project.<br><br>“The plan is to restore the vibrancy of the neighborhood,” Haney said.<br><br>Dubbed Loyola Station, the project will be built in phases. Though project details have yet to be finalized, the proposed development would have about 700,000 square feet of space, with about 400 residential units and 40,000 square feet of commercial space. The first phase includes the redevelopment of a parcel just south of the Loyola El station on Sheridan Road at Arthur Avenue.

Longtime residents fear they will be pushed out by rising property values and rents. New property owners want fast improvements. “I’d like them to clean up and redevelop the main streets,” said condo owner Ramlukan. “Those old businesses are going nowhere.”<br><br>He’s confident things are moving in his direction as he points out a number of teardowns near his new condo. The second condo he bought as an investment is performing well too, he said.<br><br>Ramlukan has it rented to three people who share the 1,500–square–foot unit. He has had no trouble finding renters who were happy to get a big new place at a relatively low price. Ramlukan charges two of his renters $625 a month. The third, who has the big master suite, pays $750 a month. “This neighborhood will do well,” he said.","The long–awaited revival of Rogers Park could finally be at hand as new residents move to a steadily growing stock of new condominiums in the North Side neighborhood.<br><br>Biv Ramlukan and his fiance, Fiona Mahomed, bought two new condominium units in Rogers Park––one to live in, the other as an investment. They had looked at condos in the obvious places where young professionals settle, including the South Loop. But they picked Rogers Park for much the same reason families move to far–out suburbs: more space for the money.<br><br>The couple’s condo at 1761 Morse Ave. has 1,400 square feet, plus upgraded finishes such as granite countertops, marble sinks and cherry cabinets. “This place is 300 square feet bigger than anything we saw downtown,” said Ramlukan, a business analyst. The unit cost $305,000, a figure much less than he says he would have paid for a similar size place in a trendier neighborhood. “There’s no Starbucks here yet,” he said, figuring the coffee shop’s arrival would guarantee the neighborhood’s renaissance. “But hopefully that will come.“<br><br>Also coming is a boost from Loyola University, a pivotal Rogers Park institution. The school plans to redevelop five parcels it owns near the Loyola “L” stop, including an unsightly building that previously housed a restaurant and now serves as the school’s fine arts building.<br><br>“People have been talking about Rogers Park coming back for the last 30 years,“ said Bill Markle, a real estate developer with a new project in the neighborhood. “They used to talk about Bucktown and Wicker Park that way.”<br><br>Situated on the lakefront adjacent to Evanston, Rogers Park has always seemed like a good real estate bet. The neighborhood, often referred to as East Rogers Park, is bounded by Ridge and Devon Avenues, the lake and the Evanston border. The neighborhood just to the west, commonly called West Rogers Park, is technically West Ridge, according to the Census Bureau.<br><br>The location and amenities in Rogers Park are big pluses, developers say.<br><br>The neighborhood is about nine miles north of downtown. The elevated and Metra train lines dissect the area. Rogers Park has many public beaches, among the most of Chicago’s lakefront areas.<br><br>“If you were any place else in the city, Rogers Park would be viewed as the best neighborhood because of the beach access,” says Rich Aronson, principal at Camelot Development Inc., Chicago. “With 13 public beaches, you can walk down just about any street to the beach.”<br><br>Despite the obvious attractions, Rogers Park has traditionally been for renters, not homeowners. Much of the housing stock consists of small apartments built in the 1920s and 1930s, when housing was in short supply.<br><br>Many of the apartments are in large courtyard buildings––charming, but often difficult to convert into spacious condominiums. This has held developers back. And many longtime residents, often vocal, want to keep the area affordable.<br><br>The neighborhood is diverse and densely populated. It also has a reputation as a home for transients, a stereotype that’s been hard to shake. At dinner time, as many as 150 people line up for a free meal at the Good News Community Kitchen at 7649 N. Paulina St.<br><br>A cook who works there and rents an apartment nearby worries about where she’ll live if rents go any higher.<br><br>Rentals are converted<br><br>But gradually rental buildings in Rogers Park are being converted into condos, and new homes are being built. No one has exact numbers, but 20 years ago rental apartments comprised about 85 percent of the area’s housing stock, according to Cary Steinbuck, executive director at the Rogers Park Community Council, a neighborhood improvement organization. Today about 70 percent of the housing stock is rental. “A lot of new condominiums have been built in the last three to four years,” she said.<br><br>In 2003, about 600 condominiums and townhouses in the neighborhood were sold, according to developer Aronson, who also co–owns Camelot Realty of America Inc., a property broker active in the area.<br><br>Based on the current sales pace, Aronson expects a final tally of about 1,200 unit sales in 2005. He estimates that about 10 percent of the 1,200 units are in newly constructed buildings. The remainder is in older buildings that have been converted into condominiums. “There’s a real appetite here for new construction,” he said.<br><br>Christopher Loubsky and Jeffrey Noren bought a new three–story townhouse at 6417 N. Paulina St. “The decision was based on value,” said Loubsky, who had previously lived in Evanston as well as the Chicago neighborhoods of Lakeview and River North. They paid $349,900 for a 1,860–square–foot house that includes a two–car garage. They like the location, which Loubsky describes as a cross between a suburban retreat and urban hub. When he sits on the rooftop deck among the treetops, he feels as if he’s not in the city. He added: “We can walk anywhere, and we’re very close to transportation.”<br><br>Nicole Thomas plans to move soon to her new two–bedroom condominium at North Beach Lofts, 1225 W. Morse Ave., about one block from the lake. She paid $265,000 for a two–bedroom, two–bath unit that includes an indoor parking space. Her new place has 1,050 square feet.<br><br>“The location is awesome,” said Thomas, owner of a Glenview photography company. Her walk to the beach will take about one minute. She’ll also have an easy commute downtown.<br><br>Thomas’ building, the North Beach Lofts, has 43 units. The building serves as a good example of a problem local developers face: lack of available land. The building was an old two–story commercial property built in the late 1930s, according to developer Markle, who is president of Markle Development Inc., Evanston. Markle added three floors of new condos above the old structure. He says 31 of the units are sold. The average size of the units is about 1,350 square feet.<br><br>Developer Kenneth Sproul faced a land challenge too. He built Lakeview Pointe, a big 57–unit project on Sheridan Road at the Evanston border. The project is unusual for Rogers Park because it’s on a big piece of land just across from the lake. The land had been occupied by a gas station, car wash and old apartment building. It also sits adjacent to the Calvary Cemetery, a detail Sproul admits has turned off some buyers.<br><br>“The project has sold slower than we had hoped,” said Sproul. He thinks his building might be a little “ahead of the market“ in Rogers Park, both in terms of unit size and price. The townhomes that remain for sale have about 2,000 square feet of space, with three bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths and two parking spots. The cost is about $465,000. A large 3,125–square– foot home in the project sold for $859,000.<br><br>“If someone is looking for a new townhome, they’re generally not looking in Rogers Park,” Sproul said. “Rogers Park is known as a condo–conversion area.” He thinks most buyers in Rogers Park are looking for units in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range.<br><br>Prices are on the upswing<br><br>Property prices in Rogers Park are on the upswing, however. Developer and property broker Aronson says prices have increased about 100 percent in the last two years. Newly constructed units now bring about $270 a square foot. Converted units a little less.<br><br>Jordan Mann paid $154,900 for a 700–square–foot condo in a newly rehabbed building at 1348 N. Estes Ave., about a half block from the lake and Loyola University. He looked at places in the Andersonville and Edgewater neighborhoods, but he picked the Rogers Park building because he got more space for the money. He also likes the area’s eclectic nature. “There are people here who were walking in peace marches 40 years ago, along with hip–hop kids and Hare Krishnas,” he said. He’s also glad an effort is under way to revitalize the neighborhood.<br><br>A big boost should come from Loyola University, which plans to spearhead the redevelopment of 5.4 acres it owns on the west side of Sheridan Road near the Loyola “L” stop. The properties will not be redeveloped for the school, but to provide more housing and retail stores for the neighborhood, according to Michael R. Haney, president at Newcastle Limited, the Chicago–based advisory firm Loyola hired to handle the project.<br><br>“The plan is to restore the vibrancy of the neighborhood,” Haney said.<br><br>Dubbed Loyola Station, the project will be built in phases. Though project details have yet to be finalized, the proposed development would have about 700,000 square feet of space, with about 400 residential units and 40,000 square feet of commercial space. The first phase includes the redevelopment of a parcel just south of the Loyola El station on Sheridan Road at Arthur Avenue. Developers have been asked to submit proposals for the parcel, the site of the school’s fine arts building, which still looks much like the Denny’s restaurant it once was.<br><br>Newcastle’s Haney is quick to point out that Loyola Station is being planned with input from the community. “It’s important that the development contribute to the neighborhood in a positive way.”<br><br>But change is hard.

Article,Baby Factory' No Match for Market Pressure,"September 1, 2004","By David Roeder, Chicago Sun-Times","For untold numbers of Americans, their first experience as a consumer was with products that came out of the ""Rubens Baby Factory'' in Chicago. Officially called Rubens &amp; Marble Inc., it's been around since 1890 and in the same location since 1936, turning out T-shirts that hospitals all around the country place on newborns, accessorizing their birthday suits for the first time.  <br><br>That location is 2340 N. Racine, in the western part of Lincoln Park, where it has long since been surrounded by the leaded glass, the flowering window boxes and the high prices that denote gentrification. A property just north of it, the trade school Coyne American Institute, has been sold to be replaced by housing.  <br><br>So Rubens &amp; Marble President Richard Rubens figures it's time to go. He has hired Newcastle Ltd. to conduct a sealed- bid auction of his property. Responses are due Oct. 29.  <br><br>By some estimates, his 32,000-square-foot land site could command more than $11.5 million. Rubens, the fourth generation owner, said he'd rather stay in a building he's known since age 7. But the reality, he said, is that the business is failing.  <br><br>The manufacturing of infant underwear has moved to China and Pakistan because of the cheap labor. In the meantime, Rubens said his prospects have suffered because of government-mandated increases in the minimum wage. ""I tried to raise prices to make up for that and lost a lot of business,'' he said. Discount stores used to be big customers, but now he sells mostly to hospital suppliers.  <br><br>After World War II, Rubens &amp; Marble had about 300 people on the payroll. Today, the count is 38. Rubens figures he'll cease operations sometime in November.  <br><br>Another factor in his decision is that he's 59 and his two sons, one a doctor and the other a lawyer, don't want to follow his footsteps into the ""baby factory.''  <br><br>Developers have pestered him over the years to sell, so he figured he'd put it up for auction to get the best price.  <br><br>But now with the shutdown looming, his staff is working overtime to meet the orders from customers that haven't lined up new suppliers. Rubens said he's had to resist the temptation to stage an equivalent of those never-ending ""liquidation'' sales of Persian rugs. ","For untold numbers of Americans, their first experience as a consumer was with products that came out of the ""Rubens Baby Factory'' in Chicago.

Racine, in the western part of Lincoln Park, where it has long since been surrounded by the leaded glass, the flowering window boxes and the high prices that denote gentrification. A property just north of it, the trade school Coyne American Institute, has been sold to be replaced by housing.  <br><br>So Rubens &amp; Marble President Richard Rubens figures it's time to go. He has hired Newcastle Ltd. to conduct a sealed- bid auction of his property. Responses are due Oct. 29.  <br><br>By some estimates, his 32,000-square-foot land site could command more than $11.5 million. Rubens, the fourth generation owner, said he'd rather stay in a building he's known since age 7. But the reality, he said, is that the business is failing.  <br><br>The manufacturing of infant underwear has moved to China and Pakistan because of the cheap labor. In the meantime, Rubens said his prospects have suffered because of government-mandated increases in the minimum wage. ""I tried to raise prices to make up for that and lost a lot of business,'' he said. Discount stores used to be big customers, but now he sells mostly to hospital suppliers.  <br><br>After World War II, Rubens &amp; Marble had about 300 people on the payroll. Today, the count is 38. Rubens figures he'll cease operations sometime in November.  <br><br>Another factor in his decision is that he's 59 and his two sons, one a doctor and the other a lawyer, don't want to follow his footsteps into the ""baby factory.''  <br><br>Developers have pestered him over the years to sell, so he figured he'd put it up for auction to get the best price.  <br><br>But now with the shutdown looming, his staff is working overtime to meet the orders from customers that haven't lined up new suppliers. Rubens said he's had to resist the temptation to stage an equivalent of those never-ending ""liquidation'' sales of Persian rugs. ",,

Acquired by Silver Cross over the years, the sites, ranging in size from 220 acres to 70 acres, are located along developing commercial corridors within these growing residential communities.<br><br>“These properties will help accommodate future growth in the County and maximize the value of the Hospital’s assets to upgrade current facilities and expand the Hospital’s outpatient network. As part of a long-term investment strategy, we decided this was the right time to utilize this capital to help the Hospital achieve its long-term goals,” said William Brownlow, chief financial officer, Silver Cross Hospital. Silver Cross will retain five to 20 acres at each of these sites for future facilities.<br><br>The first development site is located at the southeast corner of Route 6 and Clinton Road in the Village of New Lenox. This 70-acre site benefits from close proximity to I-80 and the full interchange at Route 6 and I-355, which is currently under construction and will be opened to traffic in the fall of 2007. Based on its excellent access and visibility from these highways, this site would be ideal for retail or commercial development.<br><br>The second development site, consisting of 160 acres, is located at the northeast quadrant of Routes 30 (Lincoln Highway) and 45 (LaGrange Road), in the Village of Frankfort. This property is one of Will County’s premier development sites due to its size, frontage and location at the crossroads of two major arterial roads. With proposed full-access points at 93rd Street and Pfeiffer Road, and a growing population in the market area, an ideal use for this site would be a combination of retail, residential and commercial development.<br><br>The third development site, known as “Village Station”, spans 220 acres and is located at the northeast and southeast corners of Cedar and Laraway Roads in the Village of New Lenox. When completed, this master planned community, will be a model for transit-oriented developments, and will become the new focal point of the area. The first phase was completed in December 2005 with the opening of a new Metra station and a 318-car parking lot. The property surrounds the Metra station and is ready to be redeveloped for residential and commercial uses.<br><br>“Each of these sites offer tremendous opportunities for development and will appeal to a broad range of buyers,” said Perry Higa, first vice president, CB Richard Ellis.<br><br>Newcastle Limited’s Peter Tortorello, along with CB Richard Ellis’ Perry Higa and Thomas Goebel are the exclusive marketing agents for the properties.

Press Release,Mundelein Center Rehab Key to $85M Loyola Project,"September 14, 2005",,"CHICAGO – The bulk of a local university’s $85–million redevelopment project will be spent at a building that once was the tallest in the city. The 14–story Mundelein Center building is not located Downtown, but rather nearly eight miles north at 1012–28 W. Sheridan Rd. in the Rogers Park community.Loyola University could receive up to $20.4 million in tax increment financing for the entire project, which will include work on three residence halls and streetscapes. However, more than $62 million is budgeted for repairing the 76–year–old Mundelein Center, which is on the National Register of Historic Buildings, where 25% of the space is unusable because of its disrepair, says Michelle Dewlen of the department of planning and development.The tax increment financing proposal, endorsed Tuesday by the community development commission, calls for the university to front–fund the entire project, with reimbursements from the city coming on a “pay as you go” basis, assuming university–owned properties are generating revenue. In addition to its own fund–raising, university officials are considering historic tax credits, says vice president of capital planning Wayne Magdziarz.To get the $20.4 million in tax increment financing, the university agreed to have the Mundelein Center designated a Chicago landmark, which will give the city additional oversight over changes to its façade. In addition, the university agreed to an approval process that requires community, department of planning and development as well as city council involvement as redevelopment of the lakefront campus continues.“We’re still in somewhat of a buying mode for strategic properties around our campus,” Magdziarz says. With 15,000 students enrolled at the lakefront campus, the space there is only one–third what is needed for a student body that size, he adds.When work is completed in 2009, the university plans to move its performing and fine arts programs to Mundelein Center. The building will get new elevator, heating, ventilation and air conditioning as well as electrical systems during its three–year renovation. While “green roofs” will be installed, they will replace portions that already are leaking. In addition, work is needed on the foundation, and the building will be made handicapped accessible.“This has long been a building, and a project, that has been out there, and one that we recognize is important not only to the university but the community,” Magdziarz says.

On November 16, 1936, the building was purchased to house Rubens &amp; Marble, a company that specialized in the manufacture of quality infant’s cotton underwear since its founding in 1890. In 1912, the company was incorporated, and the name has remained the same for 92 years. In fact the same drawing of the building has appeared on the company letterhead for more than 60 years.<br><br>“The peak for our business was during the Baby Boom following World War II. At that time I am told there were 300 employees making baby clothes to meet the demand,” said Richard A. Rubens, President of Rubens &amp; Marble. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company averaged approximately 95 employees. Today there are 38 employees, but not for long. Rubens &amp; Marble will close for good by Thanksgiving of this year.<br><br>“We can no longer compete. The imports coming from China are cheaper than I can manufacture them for. The quality? Not bad,” he said. According to Rubens, the primary downside of imports is the limited line. “Whereas we make baby underwear in all oddball sizes and styles, the exporters only make the most popular sizes and styles,” he said.<br><br>Other factors contributing to the demise of Rubens &amp; Marble include his two sons’ decisions not to carry on the textile manufacturing business (but to become a doctor and a lawyer) and competition from volume discounters. “At one time, we sold to the big discount stores, but today we are national institutional suppliers serving hospitals across the country,” he said.<br>According to Rubens, by far the most significant factor leading to the demise of his business is the dramatic increase in the minimum wage. “The State of Illinois raised the minimum wage by $.35 per hour in January of this year. When we raised our prices to absorb the increase, we lost a ton of business. Now the minimum wage is set to increase another dollar per hour from $5.50 to $6.50 per hour on January 1st of 2005. It is the last straw. You can’t make money when your costs keep going up and your volume keeps going down,” he said.<br><br>Over the years the company has become a well-known neighbor in Lincoln Park. “We occasionally sell to the public from two desks piled high with baby clothes,” Rubens said. Along the way, it has even acquired a nickname. “Our building is located just down the street from the Oscar F. Mayer Grade School (2250 North Clifton Avenue). During the early 1970s, a little girl attending the school used to eat her lunch in the lobby of our building to avoid being taunted by the schoolboys. She referred to the building as the Rubens Baby Factory, and it stuck,” he said.<br><br>Rubens admits it is upsetting to leave a building he has been coming to since he was seven years old, but he’s not bitter. “Right now we are extremely busy serving our customers, but I am looking forward to traveling.”<br><br>If you drive by the building today, you will see a sign in the window that says “Rubens Baby Factory Store.” Come Thanksgiving, you may also see another sign: “Gone fishing.<br><br>About Newcastle Limited<br>Chicago-based Newcastle Limited is a national commercial real estate firm serving governmental agencies, institutions, not-for-profit organizations, corporations and private investors.

Rubens &amp; Marble will close for good by Thanksgiving of this year.<br><br>“We can no longer compete. The imports coming from China are cheaper than I can manufacture them for. The quality? Not bad,” he said. According to Rubens, the primary downside of imports is the limited line. “Whereas we make baby underwear in all oddball sizes and styles, the exporters only make the most popular sizes and styles,” he said.<br><br>Other factors contributing to the demise of Rubens &amp; Marble include his two sons’ decisions not to carry on the textile manufacturing business (but to become a doctor and a lawyer) and competition from volume discounters. “At one time, we sold to the big discount stores, but today we are national institutional suppliers serving hospitals across the country,” he said.<br>According to Rubens, by far the most significant factor leading to the demise of his business is the dramatic increase in the minimum wage. “The State of Illinois raised the minimum wage by $.35 per hour in January of this year. When we raised our prices to absorb the increase, we lost a ton of business. Now the minimum wage is set to increase another dollar per hour from $5.50 to $6.50 per hour on January 1st of 2005. It is the last straw. You can’t make money when your costs keep going up and your volume keeps going down,” he said.<br><br>Over the years the company has become a well-known neighbor in Lincoln Park. “We occasionally sell to the public from two desks piled high with baby clothes,” Rubens said. Along the way, it has even acquired a nickname. “Our building is located just down the street from the Oscar F. Mayer Grade School (2250 North Clifton Avenue). During the early 1970s, a little girl attending the school used to eat her lunch in the lobby of our building to avoid being taunted by the schoolboys. She referred to the building as the Rubens Baby Factory, and it stuck,” he said.<br><br>Rubens admits it is upsetting to leave a building he has been coming to since he was seven years old, but he’s not bitter. “Right now we are extremely busy serving our customers, but I am looking forward to traveling.”<br><br>If you drive by the building today, you will see a sign in the window that says “Rubens Baby Factory Store.” Come Thanksgiving, you may also see another sign: “Gone fishing.<br><br>About Newcastle Limited<br>Chicago-based Newcastle Limited is a national commercial real estate firm serving governmental agencies, institutions, not-for-profit organizations, corporations and private investors.

Press Release,"Newcastle Limited Negotiates $16,500,000 Sale of Loyola University Chicago's Forest Park Office Building","March 17, 2004",,"CHICAGO – Newcastle Limited represented Loyola University of Chicago in the $16,500,000 sale of a 210,000 SF five-story contemporary office building in Forest Park, IL, announced Michael R.

The new school is scheduled for occupancy during August of 2005 with classes starting that fall.“This property was offered through a sealed-bid process, and the district was one of the bidders.

Press Release,"Newcastle Limited Negotiates Sale of Chicago's 78-Year-Old, 1,300,000 SF South Water Market to The Enterprise Companies","July 17, 2003",,"CHICAGO – Newcastle Limited represented the 73 owners of the South Water Market Unit Sales, LLC, in the $35,000,000 sale of Chicago’s historic 78-year-old, 1,300,000 SF, 14-acre South Water Market produce terminal. The sale closed on July 11, announced Michael R. Haney, President of the Chicago-based real estate firm, retained by the association to provide disposition services. Newcastle Limited is a national real estate advisory and development firm serving not-for-profit organizations, institutions, investors, corporations and governmental agencies.<br><br>The six, circa: 1920s, terra-cotta-clad, three-story warehouse buildings that comprise South Water Market will be retained, fully renovated and retrofitted as part of the residential development plan by the buyer, The Enterprise Companies, a Chicago-based real estate developer and loft-conversion pioneer. The new development, named University Commons, highlights the excellent Near West Side location of the five-city-block property, situated between 14th Place and 15th Place and between Morgan Street and South Racine Avenue, immediately east of University Village. The property is bounded by the Chicago ABLA residential communities on the north and west; a Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad embankment on the south; University Village and the University of Illinois Chicago’s South Field Sports Complex on the east.<br><br>The original market was started in the late 1800s on South Water Street at East Wacker Drive and State Street, but was closed down on August 27, 1925, and moved to its present terminal to make way for the construction of Wacker Drive. Designed by the architectural firm of Fugard &amp; Knapp, the new South Water Market terminal was subdivided into 166 units and sold to merchants on a fee-simple basis. The market property is comprised of six long buildings, each with between 23 and 33 bays, raised loading platforms and broad canopies. For decades it served as Chicago’s main wholesale fresh produce market, distributing food to restaurants and grocery stores across the city.<br><br>Over the last 40 years, there have been many failed attempts to achieve consensus for relocating the terminal and redeveloping the site. In 1963 Arthur Rubloff offered to build a new market and buy the old site. His offer was rejected. Since then there have been more than a dozen additional unsuccessful offers to redevelop the site.<br><br>The first goal of relocating the terminal was accomplished last year when CenterPoint Properties Trust (NYSE: CNT), in partnership with the City of Chicago, developed the new 25.7-acre, $58,000,000, state-of-the-art, 436,224 SF industrial condominium complex, called the Chicago International Produce Market. The new produce market is located a couple of miles southwest of South Water Market on Wolcott Street, just south of Blue Island Avenue. The new building has 36 individual units, each with 12,117 SF. The Chicago International Produce Market officially opened on September 21, 2002, and is already 100 percent sold.<br><br>“When we were retained to represent the owners’ association in May of 2002, the property was over 90 percent occupied. We brought the property to market in November of 2002. By the time of the offers deadline on January 17, 2003, the property was less than 50 percent occupied. When we officially turned over the property to the new owner, only approximately 15 merchants remain on leases of varying durations with The Enterprise Companies,” said S.L. van der Zanden, Managing Director of Newcastle Limited and Project Manager for this transaction.<br><br>Newcastle worked closely with the owners, the Chicago Department of Planning &amp; Development, the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois, and Alderman Daniel Solis (25th Ward) to prepare this property for disposition. “Our company specializes in highly complex real estate transactions involving consensus-building, property-transformation solutions. Complexity issues associated with the South Water Market transaction were numerous, but topping the list has to be the number of owners. We dealt with 73 owners in order to build consensus for the sale, the sealed-bid disposition strategy, the pricing and terms of the winning offer, the language in the documentation, and the coordination of 73 separate closings,” said van der Zanden.<br>Another complicating factor came to light during the buyer’s due diligence period. “A careful review of the title revealed a 1925 deed provision restricting the use of the property to a produce market. In order to waive this restriction and make way for redevelopment, we reviewed legal precedent and the economic realities, then worked with the owners, the buyer and Chicago Title Company to minimize risk and build consensus,” he said.<br><br>The third major complication was the architectural and historical significance of South Water Market. The complex was number 12 on the Illinois Landmark Preservation Council of Illinois’ “Chicagoland Watch List” for 2002 and is one of the 9,600 buildings on the “Orange” list of potentially significant buildings in the context of the surrounding community, complied by the City of Chicago’s Commission on Chicago Landmarks in its comprehensive 1995 Chicago Historic Resources Survey. “We worked diligently to generate interest from prospective developers with the experience to re-use the buildings in order to avoid the inevitable delays and uncertainties inherent in the demolition of any property,” van der Zanden said.<br><br>“We are absolutely ecstatic with the outcome of this disposition. It’s easy to save a highly visible, high-styled monument building, but to have such a complete preservation scheme worked out for a vernacular industrial complex like South Water Market is a tougher job for developers,” said David A. Bahlman, President, Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois. According to him, our culture’s reverence for history has broadened significantly over the last 50 years. “This egalitarian movement demonstrates that we value all human activity, recognizing that the grocery distributor is as important as the bank president,” he said.<br><br>“Everyone is pleased with the outcome of this sale,” said Gene Ruffolo, who along with Peter Testa, serve as Co-Managing Partners of South Water Market Unit Sales, LLC, formed two and a half years ago to spearhead the successful disposition effort. “No one person made this happen. It was a team effort of our owners, the city, the preservationists, our attorneys and our real estate advisors,” said Ruffolo, who made a special point of acknowledging the efforts of attorney, Mark T. O’Toole with Foran Nasharr &amp; O’Toole LLC, who introduced the managing partners to Newcastle Limited and acted as legal counsel for the 73 sellers.<br><br>Commenting on why the disposition effort was successful this time around, Ruffolo mentioned the association’s efforts to secure the cooperation of 73 owners before it retained Newcastle. “Newcastle presented the owners with a 100-page spiral notebook that included a comprehensive overview of the market, all environmental issues and an honest and straightforward description of the property. It contained all the facts we needed to make decisions. We are very grateful for Newcastle’s integrity, honesty, persistence and the quiet way in which they worked,” he said.<br><br>“Although the city’s ‘orange’ designation allows us to demolish the existing structures on the property, we are saving these historical buildings without requesting official landmark status,” said Ron Shipka, Jr., Principal of The Enterprise Companies. The family-owned company specializes in residential developments that emphasize a sense of responsibility for preserving the character of Chicago’s neighborhoods. The firm redevelops distinguished landmark and architecturally significant buildings in addition to building new loft, townhouse, single-family, mid-rise and high-rise projects, which reflect state-of-the-art design and technology.<br><br>According to Shipka, redevelopment of the 850-unit loft condominium project, valued at approximately $250,000,000, will include the addition of a fourth level allowing both single-story and townhouse configurations. One-bedroom/one-bath plans, ranging in price from approximately $150,000 to $200,000, will comprise 30 percent of the units; two-bedroom/two-bath plans from $240,000 to $325,000 will comprise 55 percent of the units; and three-bedroom/two-bath plans from $350,000 to $450,000 will make up the balance. Amenities include rear yards, covered decks or patios, balconies, penthouse rooftop decks and underground parking.<br><br>“We are offering Chicago something it very much needs – affordable pricing. In a residential market, characterized by development costs of $275 PSF to $300 PSF – and between $500 PSF and $600 PSF for lakefront properties – we are basing our pricing structure on $250 PSF,” said Shipka. In addition, the developer is introducing a new “extra room” concept in each unit. “People don’t want their computer stations in their bedrooms or living rooms, so we are providing extra private space in each unit to accommodate this requirement,” he said.<br><br>Designed by Chicago architect, Pappageorge/Haymes Ltd., University Commons will be developed in six phases. The first phase of 150 units will be offered for sale beginning in January of 2004. “Timing of subsequent phases will be determined by market demand. Absorption of 850 units – one of the city’s largest planned unit developments – is a challenge; however, we believe the project’s close proximity to the Loop and its nostalgic appeal, combined with a lack of existing affordable alternatives, will be the keys to our success,” Shipka said.<br><br>Immediately east of South Water Market is University Village, a $75,000,000, 68-acre, mixed-use development that is Chicago’s fastest-growing residential community. When completed, University Village will consist of 930 new residential units, 120,000 SF of retail space, public parks, and UIC dormitories and academic buildings. The South Water Market site is within close proximity to nearby institutions including the University of Illinois at Chicago, Rush/St. Luke Medical Campus, Illinois Medical District and the prestigious St. Ignatius College Preparatory High School. The surrounding communities of Little Italy, Greektown, Pilsen, and Chinatown provide the dynamic cultural diversity of ethnic restaurants and entertainment. The site has exceptional access to I-94, I-90, I-55 and I-290 and is within walking distance of University Marketplace, a new 120,000 SF retail corridor.<br>In addition to the South Water Market disposition, Newcastle recently represented Baxter International in a sealed-bid disposition of a 70-acre development property in Lake County; represented Loyola University Chicago in the disposition of its 17-acre Mallinckrodt Campus to the Wilmette Park District; and represented the Eleanor Women’s Foundation in the disposition of its 1550 North Dearborn Parkway building to The Latin School of Chicago.

In order to waive this restriction and make way for redevelopment, we reviewed legal precedent and the economic realities, then worked with the owners, the buyer and Chicago Title Company to minimize risk and build consensus,” he said.<br><br>The third major complication was the architectural and historical significance of South Water Market. The complex was number 12 on the Illinois Landmark Preservation Council of Illinois’ “Chicagoland Watch List” for 2002 and is one of the 9,600 buildings on the “Orange” list of potentially significant buildings in the context of the surrounding community, complied by the City of Chicago’s Commission on Chicago Landmarks in its comprehensive 1995 Chicago Historic Resources Survey. “We worked diligently to generate interest from prospective developers with the experience to re-use the buildings in order to avoid the inevitable delays and uncertainties inherent in the demolition of any property,” van der Zanden said.<br><br>“We are absolutely ecstatic with the outcome of this disposition. It’s easy to save a highly visible, high-styled monument building, but to have such a complete preservation scheme worked out for a vernacular industrial complex like South Water Market is a tougher job for developers,” said David A. Bahlman, President, Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois. According to him, our culture’s reverence for history has broadened significantly over the last 50 years. “This egalitarian movement demonstrates that we value all human activity, recognizing that the grocery distributor is as important as the bank president,” he said.<br><br>“Everyone is pleased with the outcome of this sale,” said Gene Ruffolo, who along with Peter Testa, serve as Co-Managing Partners of South Water Market Unit Sales, LLC, formed two and a half years ago to spearhead the successful disposition effort. “No one person made this happen. It was a team effort of our owners, the city, the preservationists, our attorneys and our real estate advisors,” said Ruffolo, who made a special point of acknowledging the efforts of attorney, Mark T. O’Toole with Foran Nasharr &amp; O’Toole LLC, who introduced the managing partners to Newcastle Limited and acted as legal counsel for the 73 sellers.<br><br>Commenting on why the disposition effort was successful this time around, Ruffolo mentioned the association’s efforts to secure the cooperation of 73 owners before it retained Newcastle. “Newcastle presented the owners with a 100-page spiral notebook that included a comprehensive overview of the market, all environmental issues and an honest and straightforward description of the property. It contained all the facts we needed to make decisions. We are very grateful for Newcastle’s integrity, honesty, persistence and the quiet way in which they worked,” he said.<br><br>“Although the city’s ‘orange’ designation allows us to demolish the existing structures on the property, we are saving these historical buildings without requesting official landmark status,” said Ron Shipka, Jr., Principal of The Enterprise Companies. The family-owned company specializes in residential developments that emphasize a sense of responsibility for preserving the character of Chicago’s neighborhoods. The firm redevelops distinguished landmark and architecturally significant buildings in addition to building new loft, townhouse, single-family, mid-rise and high-rise projects, which reflect state-of-the-art design and technology.<br><br>According to Shipka, redevelopment of the 850-unit loft condominium project, valued at approximately $250,000,000, will include the addition of a fourth level allowing both single-story and townhouse configurations. One-bedroom/one-bath plans, ranging in price from approximately $150,000 to $200,000, will comprise 30 percent of the units; two-bedroom/two-bath plans from $240,000 to $325,000 will comprise 55 percent of the units; and three-bedroom/two-bath plans from $350,000 to $450,000 will make up the balance. Amenities include rear yards, covered decks or patios, balconies, penthouse rooftop decks and underground parking.<br><br>“We are offering Chicago something it very much needs – affordable pricing. In a residential market, characterized by development costs of $275 PSF to $300 PSF – and between $500 PSF and $600 PSF for lakefront properties – we are basing our pricing structure on $250 PSF,” said Shipka. In addition, the developer is introducing a new “extra room” concept in each unit. “People don’t want their computer stations in their bedrooms or living rooms, so we are providing extra private space in each unit to accommodate this requirement,” he said.<br><br>Designed by Chicago architect, Pappageorge/Haymes Ltd., University Commons will be developed in six phases. The first phase of 150 units will be offered for sale beginning in January of 2004. “Timing of subsequent phases will be determined by market demand. Absorption of 850 units – one of the city’s largest planned unit developments – is a challenge; however, we believe the project’s close proximity to the Loop and its nostalgic appeal, combined with a lack of existing affordable alternatives, will be the keys to our success,” Shipka said.<br><br>Immediately east of South Water Market is University Village, a $75,000,000, 68-acre, mixed-use development that is Chicago’s fastest-growing residential community. When completed, University Village will consist of 930 new residential units, 120,000 SF of retail space, public parks, and UIC dormitories and academic buildings. The South Water Market site is within close proximity to nearby institutions including the University of Illinois at Chicago, Rush/St. Luke Medical Campus, Illinois Medical District and the prestigious St. Ignatius College Preparatory High School. The surrounding communities of Little Italy, Greektown, Pilsen, and Chinatown provide the dynamic cultural diversity of ethnic restaurants and entertainment. The site has exceptional access to I-94, I-90, I-55 and I-290 and is within walking distance of University Marketplace, a new 120,000 SF retail corridor.<br>In addition to the South Water Market disposition, Newcastle recently represented Baxter International in a sealed-bid disposition of a 70-acre development property in Lake County; represented Loyola University Chicago in the disposition of its 17-acre Mallinckrodt Campus to the Wilmette Park District; and represented the Eleanor Women’s Foundation in the disposition of its 1550 North Dearborn Parkway building to The Latin School of Chicago.

Press Release,Newcastle Limited Represents YMCA in Sale of 254-Acre Hastings Lake Site to Lake County Forest Preserve District,"May 1, 2003",,"CHICAGO – Newcastle Limited represented the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago in the disposition of its 254-acre Hastings Lake site to the Lake County Forest Preserve District in a no-contingency $10,000,000 sale transaction, announced Michael R. Haney, President of Chicago-based Newcastle Limited, a national real estate advisory and development firm serving corporations, not-for-profit organizations, institutions, investors, and governmental agencies.The Hastings Lake property is located at the corner of Grass Lake and Gelden Roads in unincorporated Lake County, adjacent to Lindenhurst and Lake Villa. It features beautiful rolling typography, stately trees and a 75-acre recreational lake for fishing, boating and swimming. “This is an extremely large, contiguous and rare parcel that has served as the YMCA’s summer camp since 1922,” said Haney whose company conducted a sealed-bid offering for the property with a deadline of February 12, 2003.“We received an exceptional number of offers from qualified developers, public entities and private citizens. The property, located in the heart of the Lake County growth corridor, could have been developed in a number of ways. However, the Lake County Forest Preserve’s willingness to pay a market price for the property enabled the YMCA to preserve the land and fulfill its commitment to community service,” said Haney.In April, the Lake County Forest Preserve Board of Commissioners unanimously approved the purchase of the 254-acre property and named it Hastings Lake Forest Preserve. The new forest preserve features beautiful mature woods, open fields, wetlands and approximately two miles of shoreline and beaches. The transaction is scheduled to close this July.“The Lake County Forest Preserve is a great purchaser for our Hastings Lake property, because it will become a significant recreational resource for public use countywide,” said Stephen S. Cole, YMCA’s President and Chief Executive Officer. The YMCA will continue to serve local residents by retaining ownership of 11 acres including a 12,700 SF community center with indoor swimming pool and locker facilities. “The YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago’s Board of Managers recently authorized the reinvestment of up to $500,000 to improve this property including the construction of day-camp pavilions, scheduled for completion in the summer of 2004,” said Cole.“This is an ideal place for outdoor recreation including hiking, biking, fishing and light boating. First we will create a master plan for the site, which will include wildlife restoration areas and nature trails through the property for hikers and bicyclists,” said Tom Hahn, Director of Land Acquisition for the Forest Preserve. Land acquisition and improvements for the new Hastings Lake Forest Preserve will be funded from an $85,000,000 bond issue, approved in 2000 by Lake County voters, of which $70,000,000 is earmarked specifically for the acquisition of land and $15,000,000, for development.The YMCA is responsible for the demolition of 99 summer-camp cabins and all other buildings except four, which will be used by the Forest Preserve for storage and other purposes. After the closing, the Forest Preserve intends to sell a 2.5-acre parcel of land along Grass Lake Road to the Lake Villa Fire Protection District as the site for its new substation.Newcastle is also currently handling the disposition of the 77-year-old, 14-acre South Water Market on the Near West Side of Chicago and a 210,000 SF office building in Forest Park for Loyola University Chicago.

Press Release,"Newcastle Limited Represents Hull House in Disposition of Jane Addams Center for $1,950,000","February 27, 2003",,"CHICAGO – Newcastle Limited represented the Jane Addams Hull House Association in the sale of the 12,825 SF Jane Addams Center property for $1,950,000 to a private investment partnership, headed by local developer, Marc Realty, announced Michael R. Haney, President of Chicago-based Newcastle Limited, a national real estate advisory and development firm serving corporations, not-for-profit organizations, institutions, investors, and governmental agencies. The transaction closed in January of this year.The property, located at 3212 North Broadway in Chicago, will be redeveloped as a health and fitness center, called Lakeview Athletic Club, scheduled to open during the fourth quarter of this year. Meanwhile the developer is working closely with Hull House to develop joint programs and with area groups, neighborhood organizations and schools to offer activities, specifically designed to meet the needs of the community.In 1889, a group of idealistic young people, led by Jane Addams, set out to promulgate a philosophy that crime, illiteracy and poverty could be mitigated by social service settlements deeply rooted in the community. The Hull House they created became Chicago’s premier human-services agency and the most famous settlement community in America. Today the not-for-profit Jane Addams Hull House Association reaches 100,000 residents in the Chicago metropolitan area with more than 60 community-focused programs, dedicated to helping people build better lives.Thirty years ago, the association acquired the circa-1900 American Legion hall on Broadway near Belmont Avenue and opened the Jane Addams Center. In 1963 the Hull House Theater opened at the center with Frank Gilroy’s “Who’ll Save the Plowboy?” and became a trailblazing force in the creation of the off-Loop community theater industry in Chicago.“Today the property is not adequate to serve the association’s mission, but the proceeds are dedicated to continuing its community-focused approach to solving social problems by fostering the spirit of ‘neighbors helping neighbors,’” said Haney.

Newcastle is a national real estate advisory and development firm serving not-for-profit organizations, institutions, investors, corporations and governmental agencies.Retained by Loyola to market the property in the fall of 2001, Newcastle conducted a fast-track sealed-bid offering that resulted in a purchase contract for residential development by successful bidder, a joint venture between Edward R. James Partners LLC and Valenti Builders, in less than 10 weeks. Subsequently the citizens of Wilmette approved a Wilmette Park District referendum on March 19 of this year authorizing the district to issue general obligation bonds to purchase the property and fund its development for municipal or park purposes. The purchase agreement, approved by the Wilmette Park District’s Board of Park Commissioners on August 12, followed five months of negotiations.“This was a complex transaction on many levels. It involved the university, a residential developer, a village, its citizens, and an independent park district, all with differing points of view and real estate philosophies. But in the end, the sale proved to be beneficial for all concerned. Wilmette residents got the property; the park district successfully facilitated a citizen mandate for the acquisition; and the university accomplished one of the objectives in its ongoing multi-phase master plan,” said Haney whose company is currently marketing a 24,800 SF high-rise development site within Loyola University Chicago’s Water Tower Campus through a sealed-bid offering that closes on Friday, October 11.“Loyola University, with the support of the James/Valenti joint venture, worked cooperatively with the Village of Wilmette and the Park District to keep them apprised of the disposition process and give them adequate time to evaluate the potential purchase of the property and hold the referendum necessary to authorize the purchase,” Haney said.The Mallinckrodt Campus property, located at the southwest corner of Ridge Road and Elmwood Avenue, includes two small structures and a 170,000 SF building at 1041 Ridge Road that housed Loyola’s School of Education.

Press Release,Recognizes the Auditorium Theatre with Chicago Landmark Award for Preservation Excellence,"August 9, 2002",,"CHICAGO – The City of Chicago’s Commission on Chicago Landmarks recently honored the 113-year-old Auditorium Theatre as one of 16 buildings to win recognition in the 2001 Chicago Landmark Awards for Preservation Excellence program, announced Michael R. Haney, President of Chicago-based Newcastle Limited, which is providing development management services for the $13,000,000 two-year renovation on behalf of the Auditorium Theatre Council. Newcastle is a national real estate advisory and development firm serving not-for-profit organizations, institutions, investors, corporations and governmental agencies.During 2001 the commission’s Permit Review Committee selected the winning projects after reviewing more than 700 buildings, all designated by the City Council as individual Chicago Landmarks or as part of a Chicago Landmark District. According to Commission Chairman David Mosena, Chicago has more than 170 individual landmark buildings, monuments and sites, and 34 designated landmark districts totaling approximately 4,500 structures. Since Mayor Richard M. Daley took office in 1989, 115 designations have been made.“Diverse project like these demonstrate the important contributions that building owners make to the preservation of our city’s rich historic and architectural heritage,” said Mosena. “We are proud to recognize their outstanding and important work for preserving these building and keeping them in active use,” he said.In 2000, the State of Illinois’ Department of Commerce and Community Affairs awarded $13,000,000 to the Auditorium Theatre Council for its continuing renovation initiatives, and Phase One of the current renovation project was launched. “The first phase, completed last summer on time and on budget, included the extensive renovation of the original painting, mosaics and murals; an improved lobby; and the installation of new carpeting,” said Haney. “When the final phase of this renovation program is completed, it will be a significant step in restoring the theater to its original glory while positioning it to compete in the 21st Century,” he said.Phase Two of the renovation began on May 1 of this year and is scheduled for completion in September. This phase focuses on an extensive overhaul of the theater’s “back of house” areas including the demolition of the existing stage; construction of a new stage and trap; construction of a new orchestra pit with associated lift equipment, including movable seating and storage areas; selective demolition beneath the stage and seating areas; installation of basic mechanical, plumbing and electrical infrastructure beneath the stage and seating areas to allow for future expansion; installation of new electric supply to serve existing and future theater expansions; improvements to existing dressing rooms; creation of new wardrobe and laundry rooms in the basement; and renovation painting of the top of the historic stage reducer curtain.In presenting the prestigious award, the selection committee wrote the following description of the Auditorium Theatre:This restoration of the historic Auditorium Theatre’s magnificent arched ceiling included decorative plaster repair and repainting, the application of long-gone gold-leaf and missing stenciled designs, and the replacement of hundreds of individual light bulbs outlining the arches with ones with more historically accurate bulb shape and filament to more closely match the original illumination. Detailed historic paint analysis and research were undertaken as part of the project to return the theatre to its opulent original appearance. The theatre is part of the Auditorium Building, designed by the firm of Adler and Sullivan and a National Historic Landmark, designated a Chicago Landmark on September 15, 1976.The Auditorium Building was completed in 1889 and is considered the crowing achievement of famed architects, Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler, and their young apprentice, Frank Lloyd Wright. The building’s Auditorium Theatre was immediately acclaimed as on of the most beautiful and functional theaters in the world. The first home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (1891-1904), the theatre has hosted countless national political conventions, rock concerts, ballet performances and Broadway shows. In 1970, the Auditorium Building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.About Newcastle LimitedNewcastle Limited is a Chicago-based national commercial real estate firm serving governmental agencies, institutions, not-for-profit organizations, corporations and private investors.

This phase focuses on an extensive overhaul of the theater’s “back of house” areas including the demolition of the existing stage; construction of a new stage and trap; construction of a new orchestra pit with associated lift equipment, including movable seating and storage areas; selective demolition beneath the stage and seating areas; installation of basic mechanical, plumbing and electrical infrastructure beneath the stage and seating areas to allow for future expansion; installation of new electric supply to serve existing and future theater expansions; improvements to existing dressing rooms; creation of new wardrobe and laundry rooms in the basement; and renovation painting of the top of the historic stage reducer curtain.In presenting the prestigious award, the selection committee wrote the following description of the Auditorium Theatre:This restoration of the historic Auditorium Theatre’s magnificent arched ceiling included decorative plaster repair and repainting, the application of long-gone gold-leaf and missing stenciled designs, and the replacement of hundreds of individual light bulbs outlining the arches with ones with more historically accurate bulb shape and filament to more closely match the original illumination. Detailed historic paint analysis and research were undertaken as part of the project to return the theatre to its opulent original appearance. The theatre is part of the Auditorium Building, designed by the firm of Adler and Sullivan and a National Historic Landmark, designated a Chicago Landmark on September 15, 1976.The Auditorium Building was completed in 1889 and is considered the crowing achievement of famed architects, Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler, and their young apprentice, Frank Lloyd Wright. The building’s Auditorium Theatre was immediately acclaimed as on of the most beautiful and functional theaters in the world. The first home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (1891-1904), the theatre has hosted countless national political conventions, rock concerts, ballet performances and Broadway shows. In 1970, the Auditorium Building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.About Newcastle LimitedNewcastle Limited is a Chicago-based national commercial real estate firm serving governmental agencies, institutions, not-for-profit organizations, corporations and private investors.

Press Release,"Newcastle Limited Negotiates Sale of Eleanor Women's Foundation Property to The Latin School of Chicago for $8,300,000","January 8, 2002",,"CHICAGO – Newcastle Limited represented the 103-year-old Eleanor Women’s Foundation in the sale of its property at 1550 North Dearborn Parkway, Chicago, to The Latin School of Chicago, a 113-year-old college-preparatory school, for $8,300,000 in a sealed-bid transaction, announced Michael R. Haney, Managing Director of the Chicago-based real estate firm, retained by the foundation to provide disposition services. Newcastle Limited is a national real estate advisory and development firm serving not-for-profit organizations, institutions, investors, corporations and governmental agencies.Long one of Chicago’s most coveted sites, the 22,500 SF property is located on the southwest corner of Dearborn Parkway and North Avenue in Chicago’s prestigious Gold Coast neighborhood, overlooking the southern portion of Lincoln Park, two blocks west of Lake Michigan. From 1956 to 2001, the Foundation housed single working women on a temporary basis in its 60,000 SF, 122-room dormitory building, known as the Parkway Eleanor Club. The Foundation closed its residence on September 30 of this year, but may continue to lease space on a temporary basis.“The sale of this property enables us to take the next step in our mission to expand opportunities for women and girls to achieve economic self-sufficiency. We will now be in a position to address more issues and serve many more women and girls,” said Dr. Alison R. Hilsabeck, Chair of the Foundation’s Board of Directors.According to Haney, the property attracted a high level of interest from the real estate community. “The response to our sealed-bid offering was significant. We received a dozen offers from credible buyers; however, The Latin School’s offer was a win-win transaction for both of these not-for-profit Chicago institutions,” he said.“This acquisition will position the school to expand its Gold Coast campus in an efficient manner,” Haney said, referring to The Latin School’s Middle and Upper School at 59 West North Boulevard and the Lower School at 1531 North Dearborn Parkway.As part of the agreement, The Latin School will establish a four-year scholarship in the name of Eleanor founder, Ina Law Robertson, to be awarded in perpetuity starting in 2002. The Latin School was represented in the transaction by Martin Stern, Senior Vice President with Chicago-based U.S. Equities Realty, Inc.After the closing, Dr. Hilsabeck said, “I am struck by the way in which the Eleanor’s capacity to help women and girls has benefited by the coming together of a group of people with both extraordinary talent and the simple desire to do good things.”The rich tradition of the Eleanor Women’s Foundation dates back to 1898 when Miss Robertson, with a small grant from John Law, opened the first residence, called Hotel Edwards, for 28 women, many of whom worked as “shop girls” at Marshall Fields. The hotel soon changed its name to Hotel Eleanor. Eleanor, which means “light,” represents Miss Robertson’s belief in the “light-giving power of the service young women could render our city,” she said.
